- Kiwi is a version of the [Sangou](https://github.com/vrnavi/sangou) Discord bot. Of which uses [robocop-ng](https://github.com/reswitched/robocop-ng) as a loose base. They were made for The BearClub Discord, but are free to use.
- Sangou is currently in heavy development, and has countless features that are subject to change. Which means that Kiwi being a version of sangou is thus also in heavy development
- I can try to help you with self hosting kiwi, but dont expect much help
- Features are added to and removed from Kiwi at my whim, however the goal is for a "Kitchen Sink" compatible bot. The goal is to have Kiwi "feature complete" at `1.0.0`.
- i know very little code and considering the amount of changes im hoping to add, kiwi may break at any moment

# Usage

To use the publicly available Kiwi bot, use [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1266033074588749915)

You can also host the bot yourself. But note that it will probably be very difficult and i wont be very good at helping

- Download the bot from this repository. Stick to the release versions unless you have encountered a bug.
- Install [python 3.10](https://python.org) or later, as well as [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
- Use `pipenv install` in the root folder, where `Pipfile` is.
- Copy `config.example.py` to `config.py`, and fill it out with your bot information.
- Enter `pipenv shell`, `cd sangou`, then `python __init__.py`.
- Congratulations.

I will not help you if you wish to use something other than pipenv.
